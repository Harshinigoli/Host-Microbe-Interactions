The human aryl hydrocarbon receptor has been reported to be a principal regulator of various 
cellular metabolic pathways which have significance in maintaining homeostasis. The structural 
and functional relationship study of AHR showed its association with various domains and 
transcriptional factors which have a critical role in balancing inflammation. The therapeutic 
approach of treating type 1 diabetes through the lactobacillus Johnsonii N6.2 strain inoculation 
paved a new path, for studying the interaction of gut microbiome with key receptors like AHR. 
SH3 homology domain has been delineated to interact with many proline rich motives and result 
in downstream regulatory pathways. The amino acid sequences of human AHR shows the 
presence of proline rich region which can potentially interact with SH3b domains of lactobacillus 
Johnsonii N6.2 Hence the current study focuses on identification of microbial ligands of the 
AHR in which the possible interaction of the proline rich region of AHR with SH3b domain is 
being investigated.
